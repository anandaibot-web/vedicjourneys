	## Introduction – Why This Journey

The journey to Mount Kailash in the year 2025 was one I embarked upon with the intention of experiencing a profound stillness beyond identity. At an altitude of 5,523 meters, this spiritual pilgrimage dissolved something within me, bringing a surprising quietude that settled amidst the monumental peaks and wide expanses. 

## The Landscape & Physical Experience

The first glimpse of the prominent snow-capped peak of Kailash was both thrilling and humbling. Here, the air is thin and crisp, urging each breath to become an act of mindfulness. The sun’s light dances on the snow, creating a kaleidoscope of reflections against the stark, rocky backdrop. Partly cloudy skies lend a shifting shadow play across the terrain, where a vast tapestry of colorful prayer flags flutter amidst the day's murmuring winds.

Trekking here is a physical challenge. Each step over the rocky terrain demands attention and presence, with the altitude presenting an invisible opponent to conquer. Yet, it is in these moments of exertion that clarity emerges, blending the line between effort and surrender.

## Inner Reflection – An Advaita Lens

The pilgrimage towards Kailash is not only a journey through heightened terrain but also into the quiet valleys of the mind. As I paced forward with fellow pilgrims, I sensed a collective introspection cut across the silence. Each individual, a mere speck amidst the vastness, walked not separately but as one continuous flow of consciousness.

The philosophical inquiry of Advaita, or non-duality, unveils itself naturally here. The dissolving of the ‘I’ into the present moment, void of narrative or desire. As I stood amidst towering peaks, it became evident that the witness and the witnessed are one; there exists no other.

## A Sloka for the Path

सर्वभूतस्थितं यो मां भजत्येकत्वमास्थितः। सर्वथा वर्तमानोऽपि स योगी मयि वर्तते॥

_Sarvabhūtasthitaṁ yo māṁ bhajatyekatvamāsthitaḥ,
Sarvathā vartamāno'pi sa yogī mayi vartate._

**Meaning:** He who sees me wherever he sees and sees everything in me, for him I am never lost, nor is he ever lost to me.

**Chapter/Verse:** Bhagavad Gita 6:30

**Explanation:** This sloka captures the essence of union beyond duality, resonating with the journey around Kailash, where the separation between seer and scenery dissolves.

## Practical Travel Notes

The journey begins with a trek through varied terrain, with rocks underfoot and snow blanketing certain stretches. It’s advisable to acclimate oneself to the altitude, allowing the body to adjust to the thin air gradually. Trekking gear is essential: layered clothing for fluctuating temperatures and a walking stick for balance.

Engaging with fellow pilgrims reveals stories and insights, bringing shared warmth to the high-altitude solitude. Consider reading previous reflections such as those found in the Katmandu2025-blog to help prepare mentally for the pilgrimage experience.

## Closing Reflection

As I make my descent, the trek to Mount Kailash leaves an indelible imprint. The journey is both an external exploration and an internal conversation, unraveling the layered fabric of identity. Here, amidst the rocks and snow, feet grounded in the earth, I discover a profound stillness that echoes beyond the journey, resonating the truth that I am not separate from this land but a part of it, here and now.
